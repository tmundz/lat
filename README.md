# LAT (Linear Algebra Toolkit in C++)

LAT is a C++ library for basic linear algebra operations, specifically focusing on matrix manipulations.

## Features

- Basic matrix operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication).
- Advanced operations (determinant, inverse, etc.).

## Current Problem
zsh kills the program when trying to make matrix that is 100000x100000

### Prerequisites
